# SubsequenceAlgos
A C program that I wrote to calculate both easy and difficult 'Common Subsequence' algorithms on the command line  
This program can calculate the following algorithms:  
Longest Common Subsequence  
Longest Palindromic Subsequence  
Longest Tandem Subsequence  
Longest Common Palindromic Subsequence  
Longest Common Tandem Subsequence  
My Program can also read in the sequences from a file, and you can generate and create files with random sequences of a given length.  
Instructions are explained further inside the program!  
*NOTE* In order to create and run the executable, use the following commands in the directory holding the files:  
make clean  
make a3  
./a3  
From here you can see the command line options to run the program with (Multiple command line arguments can be entered at once!)
